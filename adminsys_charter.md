# YunoHost System Administrator Charter

Because great powers imply great responsibilities, I commit myself as YunoHost adminsys to respect these points:

## Security
The reliability and security of our services is the responsibility of all, below are some rules to follow to avoid becoming an attack vector of the YunoHost infra :

 * do not save project password in a non-free browser or without master password;
 * do not use ssh keys without passwords to access the infrastructure (except for exceptions discussed collectively);
 * get into the habit of locking your machines where the keys are located when you leave them;
 * do not let people without access, plant third party devices in your machine(s);
 * encrypt the machines used to access the infra ;


## Ethics / practice

 * do not give yourself access by escalation of privileges and ensure that the YunoHost infrastructure administration team remains in possession of its accesses;
 * verify the effectiveness of backups and rescue means before performing risky maintenance;
 * respects privacy of our users and limit to the maximum the display of private information during debugging ;
 * in case of legal requests, do not act without consulting other contributors ;



## Resilience, sharing and transparency
In order to ensure the resilience of the deployed infrastructure, everyone agrees to do their best to:

 * report to other adminsys the operations performed on the infrastructure
 * produce documentation on their infrastructure and services;
 * create an announcement on the forum to announce any maintenance or breakdown.
