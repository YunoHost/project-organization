# YunoHost System Administrator Charter

Because great powers imply great responsibilities, I commit myself as YunoHost adminsys to respect these points:

## Security
The reliability and security of the project's services is the responsibility of everybody. Below are some rules meant to prevent security breaches / leaks on the infrastructure:

 * never save project passwords in a non-free browser or without a master password;
 * always protect personal private SSH keys with strong passwords;
 * always lock machines where keys are located before leaving them unattended;
 * always encrypt personal machines where personal SSH keys are stored;
  * never let any random people plant third party devices in your machine(s);


## Ethics / practice

 * do not give yourself access by escalation of privileges and ensure that the YunoHost infrastructure administration team remains in possession of its accesses;
 * verify the effectiveness of backups and rescue means before performing risky maintenance;
 * respects privacy of our users and limit to the maximum the display of private information during debugging ;
 * in case of legal requests, do not act without consulting other contributors ;



## Resilience, sharing and transparency
In order to ensure the resilience of the deployed infrastructure, everyone agrees to do their best to:

 * report to other adminsys the operations performed on the infrastructure
 * produce documentation on their infrastructure and services;
 * create an announcement on the forum to announce any maintenance or breakdown.
